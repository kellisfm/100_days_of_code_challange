create an class called Hat, it should take a variable number of arguments that specify the number of each type of balls that are in a hat

it should have a contents list that contains one item for each ball in the hat

class should have a draw method, that takes a number as an argument and returns a list of strings represented the drawn balls

there should also be an experiment(hat,expected_balls,num_balls_drawn,num_experiments): function that takes:

a hat class object

a dictionary of what balls you want to be drawn

the number of balls drawn per experiment

the number of experimental draws, higher more accurate in theory
