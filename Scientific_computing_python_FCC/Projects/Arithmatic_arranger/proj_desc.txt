The first problem of the five supplied in the "scientific computing with python" certification on free code camp.computing

project goal:
create a function that recieves a list of strings that arithmatic problems and returns the probelms arranged vertically and side by side, example:
  32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
  1512    22      52      162
+    5  +  2    - 21    -   5

the function should optionally take a second argument, if true, the answers should be displayed.

rules:
should return the correct conversion if the supplied problems are formatted well, else return a meaningful error msg

error situtations:
list contains more than five problems
operation is not addition or subtraction
each operand should have a max of four digits

farmatting rules:
should be a single space between the operator and the longest operand, both will be in the same order as provided
numbers right aligned
four spaces (1 tab) between each problem
dashes below each problem
