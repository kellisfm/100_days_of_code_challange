# 100_days_of_code_challange

To improve my coding skills I have decided to do a 100 days of code challange. 

### My daily goals are two-fold:

get at least 1 hour of coding in each day for the next 100 days

upload my code to github each day

### My overall goals are:

Improve my python coding capacity, particularly in: data visualization, analysis, and machine learning.

relearn HTML/CSS (I haven't touched these languages in 6 years!)

Learn basic javascript

### I am currently learning from:

Freecodecamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Scientific computing with python certification (in progress)

medium term goal courses: 

Data analysis with python certification (not started)

Machine learning with python certification (not started)
