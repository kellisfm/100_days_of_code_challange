Build a category class in the budget.py file: it should be able to create objects based on different catagories like food, cloths, entertainment

when objects are created they are passed into the catagory
class should also have an instance called ledger that is a list

the following methods should be in the calss:
deposit(amount,desc):
no description = empty string.
appends an object to the ledger list in the form of amount:amount, description:description
withdraw(amount,desc)
same as deposit but stored as a negative number

get_balance()
returns the current balance of the budget category based on deposits and withdrawls that have occured

transfer(amount, diff category), adds withdrawl to one category and deposit to the other, with disc "destination budget category", "and from budget category"

check funds(amount)
checks if the category has that much and returns true or false

when the object is printed it should display something like this:
*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
